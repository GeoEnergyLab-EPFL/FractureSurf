# FractureSurf

FractureSurf is a MATLAB-based tool designed for the analysis of CT-scan images of rock cores to detect and reconstruct fracture surfaces. This code processes a series of CT-scans taken perpendicular to a fluid-driven fracture, accurately identifying the fracture path in each scan. It then integrates these paths to create a 3D representation of the fracture surface. Additionally, FractureSurf includes various post-processing features to refine the surface model, enabling detailed analysis of fracture characteristics. Ideal for researchers and engineers in geomechanics, petroleum engineering, and related fields.
